# JewelleryManufacturersIndia
The notebooks were written in Google Colab and therefore all the dependencies are present in the notebook itself.
Scraper.ipynb is used to scrape a directory of jewellery manufacturers
get_coordinates.ipynb preprocesses this data 
and a basic gui in website.ipynb is used to present the visualized data

# Runtime instructions:
